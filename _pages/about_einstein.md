Hi, I'm Angela! I grew up in Weston, Florida. My favorite topics in econ are econometrics and environmental economics. Outside of class, I love doing ballet. Besides UEA, I am also part of MIT Code for Good and ADT (Asian Dance Team). Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about econometrics or if you just want to dance!
